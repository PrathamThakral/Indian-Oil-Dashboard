# Indian Oil Dashboard

Excited to share one of my Project of Power Bl which I've been working on a Power BI dashboard for "Indian Oil Stock" that's packed with insightful KPIs! ðŸ“Šâœ¨

Here's a sneak peek into the process:

â€¢ Imported the data from the Excel file that was taken from the Kaggle dataset.

â€¢ Cleaned, Transformed, and polished the dataset within Power BI to ensure pristine data quality.

â€¢ Crafted an array of KPIs, charts, slicers, visuals, and filters to empower in-depth exploration.

â€¢ Unearthed invaluable insights that shed light on sales by Income, Savings, Expenses, Components associated and more.
